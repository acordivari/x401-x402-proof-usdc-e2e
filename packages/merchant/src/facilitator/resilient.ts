/**
 * ResilientFacilitatorClient — wraps ANY FacilitatorClient (the live HTTP
 * client or the offline mock) and adds the safety guarantees the sandbox is
 * meant to validate, all at the single settlement boundary:
 *
 *   1. Retry: transient settle failures are retried with exponential backoff.
 *      Terminal failures (invalid payment) are never retried.
 *   2. Idempotency: settlement is keyed on the EIP-3009 authorization nonce.
 *      A nonce that already settled returns the cached result — it is never
 *      settled twice, even if the request is replayed.
 *   3. Transaction lock: concurrent settle calls for the same nonce coalesce
 *      onto one in-flight settlement, so a retry storm can't double-charge.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: clock + sleep are injectable so tests run instantly.
